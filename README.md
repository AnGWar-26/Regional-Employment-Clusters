# Regional Employment Centers of San Diego and Riverside Counties Project Proposal

### Team Members: Andrew Warfield, Connor Franklin Rey, Michelle Baron, Yiwang Li

Proposal: Our team will identify employment centers in San Diego and Riverside County.
We will then analyze the spatial footprint and industrial composition of these centers.
Specifically, we will examine the accessibility and employment composition of each center, as well as calculate measures of local economic characteristics.

#### Data Sets: identification of data sets that will be used
- Riverside and San Diego counties
